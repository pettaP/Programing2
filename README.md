# Programing2
Funtional programing with Elixir at KTH

The course covers the programming techniques used in functional programming as well as how programs can be divided into several executing thread and how these are coordinated. Example on programming technologies are recursive definitions, in-mutable data structures, higher order functions and closures. Coordination of multiple threads is shown by shared mutable data structures and by message passing
between processes.

The course will use one programming language as its main language but will also show on similarities and diferences with other functional languages

Functional programming:

    Explain the fundamentals of functional programming and its operational semantics.
    Understand and be able to use the following constructions in a functional programming language: recursion, pattern matching, functions as first class objects, closures, higher order functions and in-mutable data structures.
    Implement selected algorithms in a functional programming language.
    Use the notion of asymptotic time complexity in the evaluation of an implementation.

Concurrent programming:

    Explain the need for concurrent programming.
    Be able to evaluate the advantages and disadvantages and be able to use mechanisms to implement concurrent systems.
    Explain and demonstrate typical problem, for example race conditions, dead-lock and starvation, that can occur in concurrent programs
